  # This is the principle of using Strong Parameters.  The core idea here is we want to make sure we only allow specific information from the user to come through, specifically information we asked for, nothing more.  This prevents nefarious users from providing info that we may not want.  To get a better understanding of this, throw a raise into the create action and see the difference between the regular params and pokemon params in the little console at the bottom of the page, ðŸ‘€ peep the permitted value
  def pet_params
